# Self-Driving Car Simulation (No Libraries)
This project is a self-driving car simulation built entirely from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The simulation includes a neural network for decision-making, a visualizer for the network, and a dynamic road environment with traffic.

# Features
- Custom Neural Network: A lightweight neural network implementation powers the self-driving cars.
- Traffic Simulation: Includes multiple dummy cars to simulate real-world traffic scenarios.
- Interactive Controls: Save and discard the best-performing car's brain using local storage.
- Dynamic Visualization: Real-time rendering of the road, cars, and neural network.

# How to use 
- Use the save üíæ button to save the parameters for the current car for the next batch.
- Use discard üóëÔ∏è button to discared the currently saved parameters from local storage.
- Refresh the page to generate a new batch of cars. If saved parameters exist, they will be applied to the first car in the new batch.

# Credits
This project was created by following the Self-Driving Car with JavaScript Course ‚Äì Neural Networks and Machine Learning course by Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor. If you're interested in learning more, you can check out the course [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI).
